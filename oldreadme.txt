The game will open to a main menu with two buttons: Start Chess, and Color Settings.
Clicking Color Settings will allow you to choose the two chess board colors, the selected piece highlight color, and the possible moves highlight color.
Once you've selected your color settings and begin the chess game, it will show a standard chess board as well as a move log to the right of it.
Castling and Pawn Promotion are implemented, and en passant was very close to being implemented but couldn't be finished in time,
so we left the en passant code in the source code as comments.
When a pawn is eligible to be promoted, a promotion panel will appear on the left side of the game allowing you to choose what piece to promote it to.
The game wont let you continue until you've chosen a piece.
The game will not allow you to make a move that will put your king in check, and will also check for checkmate every time a move has been made.
