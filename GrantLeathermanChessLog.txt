	began working on the ChessPanel class which displays the actual chess game for the chess application
	- created an 8x8 grid of buttons and attached pngs of each chess piece to each button

	- made the chess pieces moveable by adding action listeners to every button so that when it is clicked, 
	it will save the png associated with that button so that when the second click is made, 
	the first button will have its png removed and the second button will have its png set to the saved png

	separated the Chess class and the ChessPanel class into separate files, but was unable to separate 
	the PieceHandler class, as it depends on variables and methods from the Chess panel file. 
	Later, when we begin working on the ChessLogPanel class we will make it a separate file by having
	the ChessPanel class write every chess move to a txt file that the ChessLogPanel class will read
	and print from

	picked up where eddie left off on validating piece moves
	- stopped the rook, bishop, and queen from being able to jump over pieces 
	
	- stopped all pieces from being able to capture its own team's pieces

	- updated the isOpponentPiece method so that it also checks if the grid location is null.
	previously it would cause an error if it was null because the Icon.toString method can't
	create a string from nothing

11/21/23
	(we ended up not having to write every chess move to a file and then having the ChessMoveLog class
	read from it. eddie instead modified the ChessPanel class to send the info directly to the ChessMoveLog)

	changed the background colors of the grid of buttons to resemble a chess board

	implented a turn system so that moves must alternate between black and white pieces

11/29/23
	helped eddie bugfix his code that would create a popup error box if a player tried to make a move that
	would put them in check

	made it so that when a piece is first selected, it shows all of the possible moves available

	fixed the issue where if you tried to select an opponent piece, you would then need to click anywhere on the board
	an extra time to attempt an invalid move so that you could then select your own piece. this is because beforehand,
	after the first click the game would always assume that you selected a valid piece and are now trying to make a move.
	you would then have to try to make this invalid move before choosing a different piece

12/4/23
	added checkmate functionality. after every move is made, it will check every single possible move for the other player 
	to see if there is a single move that would not put them in check. if there is not a single move they can make,
	it will create a popup saying the game is over and will stop players from clicking buttons

12/7/23
	began work on cleaning up the main menu and creating the color settings panel, but didn't do much other than create 
	an extra button for the color settings

12/8/23
	finished up the main menu
	- created a chess board background using Graphics2d rectangles. this background updates color when the color settings
	are changed (as well as the actual chess board once the game starts)
	- centered the buttons

	finished the color settings
	- created 4 ovals at the top with the default color settings and labels above them to describe which color setting
	- created 3 JSliders for each oval (one for red, green, and blue) that will update the settings
	- created two buttons at the bottom, one for restoring default settings and one to go back to the main menu

	added pawn promotion
	- a sidebar panel that shows up whenever a pawn reaches the end of the board, allowing you to choose
	a piece to promote it to

	made it so that castling now correctly highlights possible moves (in order to castle, you have to click the square
	where the king would end up, instead of clicking the rook to move)
